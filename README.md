### Key Components

* **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**:
    - The foundational network layer isolating resources securely. Subnets are typically segmented by availability zones (AZs) for high availability.
* **Subnets**:
    - **Public Subnets**: Hosts public-facing components like load balancers.
    - **Private Subnets**: Secured subnets for application servers, databases, and backend services, without direct internet access.
* **NAT Gateway**:
    - Allows outbound internet access for resources in private subnets.
* **Internet Gateway**:
    - Enables resources in a VPC to access the internet.
* **Load Balancer**:
    - Distributes incoming traffic across the Kubernetes deployment to ensure reliability and balance workloads.
* **Kubernetes**:
    - Cloud managed service for Kubernetes to deploy the microservices.
* **Database**:
    - We are using managed Postgres service from the cloud provider, providing persistent storage backend enabled.
* **Redis**:
    - Cloud managed Redis we are using for cache service.
* **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**:
    - Have one custom IAM role which is binding with Kubernetes service account for the specific microservice.
* **Cloud Provider Logging System**:
    - Monitoring and observability for metrics, logs, and alarms, helping maintain visibility into application health and performance.

## üîí Security Considerations

- All external inbound and outbound traffic is encrypted (HTTPS, TLS 1.2+)
- IAM policies enforce least privilege
- Application Logs enabled for monitoring and debugging
- Firewall open only required ports for traffic

**‚ÑπÔ∏è IMPORTANT NOTICE**

This Terraform configuration is designed for general cloud provider environments without any custom networking or VPC-level policies. 

If your organization enforces specific network or cloud provider policies, please fork this repository and adjust the Terraform code accordingly to ensure compliance with your organization's standards.

## Directory Structure

* cloud : Contains the cloud providers `(example : aws, gcp... etc)` specific terraform code

    * The sub folder structure should be something as this, an example for aws environment : `cloud/aws/aws_acc_id/poc/`

    * Here, 

        * `aws_acc_id` is the AWS account ID

        * `poc` is an environment name under the `aws_acc_id` and there can be `N` number of sub folder such as `test`, `stage`, `prod` etc...

        * Within `poc` environment folder, there will be the following sub folders

            * `infra-setup` : Cloud resource setup

            * `k8s-addons` : Kubernetes Addons and javelin dependencies

* config : Configurations for the infra and dependencies deployment into Kubernetes specific to each environment

    * The `config` folder having these items,

        * `common` : This directory contain configuration files for any resources that is common for all environment

        * `aws` : Cloud specific config files

            * `poc` : Environment specific configuration files, this folder is for `poc` environment

* modules : Reusable terraform modules which will be called from `cloud` folder

## Onboarding a New Environment

### AWS Environment

To add a new `aws environment` for Javelin. consider the environment name is `test`, follow these steps

#### Prerequisites

* An AWS Account

* Linux terminal in local for running Terraform Code

* Admin permission / Permission to all of the resources mentioned in the terraform from local

* AWS ACM Certificates for the following items

    * `backend domain certificate` (javelin-test-api.example.com)

    * `eval domain certificate` (javelin-test-eval.example.com)

    * `frontend domain certificate` (javelin-test.example.com)

#### Steps

* Create a new AWS environment config folder called `test` by copying `config/aws/poc` into `config/aws/test`

    * Customize the config files accourding to your environment if required under `config/aws/test` folder

* Create a new AWS environment terraform code folder called `test` by copying `cloud/aws/aws_acc_id/poc` into `cloud/aws/aws_acc_id/test`

    * `infra-setup` Terraform Code

        * Update the infra env file `cloud/aws/aws_acc_id/test/infra-setup/env.tfvars`

        * Make sure these two files haveing the same values for `region` and `bucket`

            * `cloud/aws/aws_acc_id/test/infra-setup/env.tfvars`

            * `cloud/aws/aws_acc_id/test/infra-setup/backend.tfvars`

        * One time setup - in the first run, the backend S3 bucket not available and so need to create it first

            * Disable all the infrastructure creation by updating the file `cloud/aws/aws_acc_id/poc/infra-setup/env.tfvars`

                ```bash
                enable_vpc                               = false
                enable_postgres                          = false
                enable_redis                             = false
                enable_eks                               = false
                enable_alb_sg                            = false
                enable_svc_iam                           = false
                ```

            * Comment out these lines from the file `cloud/aws/aws_acc_id/poc/infra-setup/provider.tf`

                ```bash
                # backend "s3" {
                #    use_lockfile   = true
                #    encrypt        = true
                #    key            = "infrasetup/infrasetup.tfstate"
                # }
                ```

            * Initialize terraform by running this command `terraform init -backend-config="backend.tfvars"`

            * Apply the changes by running `terraform apply -var-file="env.tfvars"`, This will create the S3 bucket for TF backend

            * Uncomment these lines from the file `cloud/aws/aws_acc_id/poc/infra-setup/provider.tf`

                ```bash
                backend "s3" {
                    use_lockfile   = true
                    encrypt        = true
                    key            = "infrasetup/infrasetup.tfstate"
                }
                ```

            * Run terraform initialization command again and this will migrate the local state file into S3 bucket. `terraform init -backend-config="backend.tfvars"`

        * Enable all the infrastructure creation by updating the file `cloud/aws/aws_acc_id/poc/infra-setup/env.tfvars`

            ```bash
            enable_vpc                               = true
            enable_postgres                          = true
            enable_redis                             = true
            enable_eks                               = true
            enable_alb_sg                            = true
            enable_svc_iam                           = true
            ```

        * Run these commands to create all resources specified in the code

            ```bash
            terraform init -backend-config="backend.tfvars"
            terraform plan -var-file="env.tfvars" # Optional for listing the resources that is going to create
            terraform apply -var-file="env.tfvars"
            ```

    * `k8s-addons` Terraform Code

        * Run this command to download the kubconfig file for communicating with EKS from local for deploying the dependencies

            * Here for kube config file, I gave the name `~/.kube/javelin-poc-eks.json`, it should match with the variable `local_kube_config` in the file `cloud/aws/aws_acc_id/test/k8s-addons/env.tfvars`

            ```bash
            export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/javelin-poc-eks.json ; aws eks update-kubeconfig --name javelin-poc-eks
            ```

        * Update the kubernetes addons env file `cloud/aws/aws_acc_id/poc/k8s-addons/env.tfvars`

        * Make sure these two files haveing the same values for `region` and `bucket`

            * `cloud/aws/aws_acc_id/test/k8s-addons/env.tfvars`

            * `cloud/aws/aws_acc_id/test/k8s-addons/backend.tfvars`

        * Enable required components to be deployed in the kubernetes by updating the file `cloud/aws/aws_acc_id/poc/k8s-addons/env.tfvars`

            ```bash
            enable_namespace                = true
            enable_docker_secret            = true
            enable_storageclass             = true
            enable_autoscaler               = true
            enable_fluent_bit               = true
            enable_ingress_alb_crds         = true
            enable_ingress_alb              = true
            enable_prometheus               = true
            enable_grafana                  = true
            enable_metrics_server           = true
            ```

        * Run these commands to create all resources specified in the code

            ```bash
            terraform init -backend-config="backend.tfvars"
            terraform plan -var-file="env.tfvars" # Optional for listing the resources that is going to create
            terraform apply -var-file="env.tfvars"
            ```

* Create `CNAME` records for those 3 domain name with the ALB domain
