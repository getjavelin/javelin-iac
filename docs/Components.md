# Cloud Components

These are the resources that we are provisioning in the cloud for setting up the Javelin

## AWS

### Resources

* VPC

    * Public subnets - for deploying the public facing resources such as ALB

    * Private subnets - for deploying the internal application such as EKS, Postgres, Redis etc..

* Aurora for Postgres

    * Required minimum 4 vCPU and 8 GB RAM, This can be changed with respect to the load in the application

    * Recommending a Global Aurora cluster for production

* ElastiCache for Redis

    * 4 GB RAM minimum

* EKS cluster with worker nodes

    * 3 node Master nodes (managed by AWS)

    * Minimum 4 nodes with 4 vCPU and 16 GB RAM - Javelin core services

    * Minimum 8 vCPU and 32 GB RAM with GPU enabled - Javelin guard models

* CloudWatch LogGroup

* Custom IAM role and policies for accessing the bedrock from Javelin (Permissions will change based on the requirements)

* EKS Dependencies

    * ALB ingress controller

    * Custom storage class with high IOPS

    * AutoScaler

    * FluentBit

    * Metric Server


### Permission and Communication

* EKS worker nodes permissions

    * AmazonEBSCSIDriverPolicy

    * Cloudwatch access

* EKS worker nodes ingress and egress

    * Postgres access internally

    * Redis access internally

    * Accept incoming request from ALB

## Azure
